# Maxwell

Displays Maxwell the cat on your 3DS.

## Building

You will need Blender and the 3DS devKitPro tools.

To parse the model, you must add `scripts/model_convert.py` as an addon in
Blender. Then, open `gfx/maxwell.blend`, go to `File > Export > Export Maxwell`,
and save as `src/maxwell.c`. Then run `make`.
